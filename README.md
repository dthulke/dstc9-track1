# Efficient Retrieval Augmented Generation from Unstructured Knowledge for Task-Oriented Dialog - DSTC9 Track 1

This repository contains the source code for the experiments in our paper ["Efficient Retrieval Augmented Generation from Unstructured Knowledge for Task-Oriented Dialog"](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15jEzjjH5ojN-facTGCQccP1Z_UgKPTVQ/view) reporting our results in [Track 1 "Beyond Domain APIs: Task-oriented Conversational Modeling with Unstructured Knowledge Access"](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-with-dstc9-track1-dataset) of [DSTC 9](https://dstc9.dstc.community).

The repository is structured as follows:
- `/baseline` contains our modified version of the [baseline code by Kim et al.](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-with-dstc9-track1-dataset)
- `/setup` contains our [sisyphus](https://github.com/rwth-i6/sisyphus) setup which we used to run our experiments
