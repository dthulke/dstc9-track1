# Sisyphus Setup

This folder contains the sisyphus setups we used to run our experiments. For details on how to setup sisyphus checkout: https://github.com/rwth-i6/sisyphus

To reproduce our results copy `_settings.py` to `settings.py` and set it up for your environment. Then run `sis manager` to run the experiments.
